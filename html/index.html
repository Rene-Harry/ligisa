            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>Ligisa Youth Network was founded in the year
                2021 by like-minded youths who felt the need
                for a platform where people could trade
                ideas and implement projects on youth
                empowerment. Three thematic areas were
                agreed upon; health, education and
                personal finance.</p>

            <h2>Health</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Based on the national youth survey, health
                    problems affecting the youth of Homabay
                    County include drug and substance abuse,
                    sexually transmitted infections and early
                    pregnancy. Health promotion and disease
                    prevention is a feasible way of promoting
                    healthy lifestyles among the youth. The main
                    strategy agreed by members is to enhance
                    awareness and facilitate access to
                    information. The objectives of the
                    organization as regards youth health is:</p>

                    <li>Create awareness on sexually transmitted infections </li>
                    <li>Create awareness on gender-based violence</li>
                    <li>Provide counseling services to help the youth cope with various challenges</li>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <div >
                <p>Homabay County has a primary school enrollment of 98%.
                    This number reduces to about 58% in secondary school
                    and dwindles even further by the time youths get to
                    tertiary level. Reasons for dropping out include
                    teenage pregnancies, lack of school fees and lack
                    of role models. Ligisa will support youth to pursue
                    education both formally and informally to levels they
                    desire in the following ways:</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running computer literacy programs- through this means
                        the world will be opened up to the youth and they will
                        get motivation from what their peers are doing around
                        the world. Additionally, it will increase their access
                        to scholarship programs which they would source online.</li>
                    <li>Promoting access to library services- this will provide
                        a safe space for studying. It will also enable access
                        to a wide range of books which will broaden the
                        perspective of the youth.</li>
                    <li>Computer based courses- these are particularly of
                        advantage to youths who have limited access to finance
                        for their studies. They also help the youth acquire
                        more skills which boosts their employability.</li>
                    <li>Life skills training- Life skills training is
                        recommended by WHO in helping to reduce early
                        pregnancy. They are helpful in assisting in the
                        transition from school life to work life. </li>
                    <li>Career mentorship programs- through this program the
                        youth will be in a position to make informed choices
                        on their career path. This will expose them to various
                        careers which are available and help in choosing ones
                        that they are passionate about.</li>
